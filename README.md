# prototype-game
Here is prototype game, to demostrate, 2d phys. engine and some patterns.


I'll demostrate with some schemas, illustrated with code, some basic approaches to tacle following items

- 2d phys. with position, speed, acceleration, collision
- camera management 
- menu management (break the game with dialogs)
- management resource (draw only what the camera sees)
- sound manager
- Input controller
- map creation
- pattern in video games (main loop, events..)

Work in progress but there short video of the prototype game running [Video](https://vimeo.com/483738054)
